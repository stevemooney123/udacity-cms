# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

#### VM or App Service
- VMs are more expensive to run.
- There are constraints on app service which are not on vm in terms of scalability.
- There is a lot less to manage in an app service making it simpler and faster to develop on.
- Vms provide more control of the environment than the app service.
- App service is not pay as you go in other words you pay even if you're not using it.
- There are language constraints on an app service compared to a VM.

#### Conclusion

I am choosing an azure app service because it is faster to deploy, and I am not a python developer therefore the additional setup would be more difficult if I used a vm.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*
